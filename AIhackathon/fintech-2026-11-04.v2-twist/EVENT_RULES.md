# Revised post-twist evaluation

All post-twist validation and final-test cases use the updated operating
conditions. The two equally weighted case groups cover routine and demanding
situations within that new world. Initial-round marks remain unchanged.
Overall stage weights remain 20% initial validation, 30% post-twist validation
and 50% final testing. Final testing uses separate private cases.

Read RECORDS.md for the exact domain action, data and scoring contract.
Historical initial training/practice remains available, but its operating
assumptions need not hold after the twist. New operating records are unlabelled
partial observations; no complete labelled post-twist replay is supplied.
Portal practice and official feedback continue under the existing attempt rules.
The same records and release times apply to every team in a domain. A submission
is evaluated with the public evidence available when it was submitted, including
when that source is later used for final testing. Resubmit to use later records.
Automatic retained initial submissions receive zero new records regardless of
queue delay. Post-twist compatibility checks imports and a callable decide
entrypoint only; actual decisions and response shape are checked by evaluation.
This check supplies no unpublished adaptation example.

# KSIT domain portal — event protocol

This is domainportal.v1. Existing calibration cohorts are reused for this human
rehearsal; they are not fresh competition finals. Follow BRIEF.md for task outcomes.

IST timetable on the organizer's explicitly configured event date: initial packet
08:00; coding 08:30–10:00, 12:00–14:00, 15:30–17:30; twist release 13:15;
final nomination cutoff and organizer-only private testing 17:45. Deployment alone
does not arm an event. Four official and four practice uploads per stage.
One public evaluation may be outstanding per team. Before 17:45 IST, captains
may withdraw their own queued or infrastructure-failed public work, including
an automatic retained evaluation. Withdrawal does not refund an accepted
attempt. Withdrawn work leaves selection without a score.

Submit a source ZIP with top-level solution.py exposing decide(observation,state),
returning exactly action and state objects. All preparation is inside the runnable
submission. Allowed files: .py, .json, .md, .txt; at most 100 files, each 2 MiB,
16 MiB uncompressed source total, 32 MiB upload. Links and nested paths forbidden.
Source is frozen by hash. Python 3.12 with numpy/pandas/scipy/sklearn is available.
Runs use pinned Docker, network disabled, UID 65534, 2 CPUs, 2 GiB, read-only source
and /public. 120-second response, 1200-second run, 1 MiB JSON frame limits apply.

Technical score: 20% pre validation + 30% post validation + 50% private final.
Post/final routine and demanding updated-condition cases receive equal weight. Task grades are
0–100; no paperwork/approach-count/preprocessing points or lateness deductions.
Public board shows validation and provisional points out of 50. Private results
and traces are organizer-only. Initial source is retained and automatically run
post-twist. Later eligible source can replace it under validation-only selection.

Agentic teams host and pay for their own HTTPS model gateway, model and provider
keys. Other domains need no external paid service. The frozen controller emits
{op:llm,messages:[{role,content}],max_output_tokens:16..2048}; the trusted relay
returns observation.llm_response and llm_usage. 1–8 successful gateway requests
per case; calls do not consume world tool units. Messages: 1–24, at most 48,000
serialized bytes; request 64 KiB, response 128 KiB, model text 64 KiB. Each gateway
call has a 45-second overall deadline. No organizer inference or fallback.
Gateway POST HTTPS port 443 accepts {messages,max_output_tokens} and returns
{text,usage?}. Provide only a restricted gateway bearer token to the portal;
provider credentials remain on your infrastructure. Public IPs only; redirects,
URL credentials/query/fragment and non-443 ports are rejected. Use the portal's
generic gateway connection check. Endpoint revisions bind to receipts: changing
a gateway requires a new submission. Keep all submitted gateway revisions and
tokens available through 19:45 IST on the event date and until the organizer
announces final testing completion if testing is extended. Calls prove requests to your gateway, not
provider attestation; finalists must show real LLM usage and unchanged gateway/model
configuration with source and provider evidence. See GATEWAY.md and gateway_example.py.
